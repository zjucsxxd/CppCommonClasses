bluCommonClasses
================

I need to author my own Data Structures for Uni.  Here they are as a work in progress; incomplete and imperfect.

**I plan on deriving them from a common Container class to simplify and standardize their design.

**They will only be unmarked as INCOMPLETE when they are a TEMPLATE or are COMPLETE.

    MISC ADS:
    
ArrayList           (like C++ vector, Java ArrayList)       INCOMPLETE
BigInteger          (For arbitrary length integers)         INCOMPLETE
BitVector64         (compact 64 bit storage for bools)      INCOMPLETE

    LL-BASED ADS:
    
DLL                 (Doubly Linked List)                    INCOMPLETE
LL                  (Singly Linked List)                    TEMPLATE
Stack               (Basic Stack)                           INCOMPLETE
Queue               (Basic Queue)                           INCOMPLETE

    TREE ADS:
    
BST                 (AVL Binary Search Tree)                ********MEMLEAKS*********
HeapTree            (Basic HeapTree)                        NOT STARTED!!
PriorityQueue       (Derived from HeapTree)                 NOT STARTED!!

    GRAPH ADS:
    
DGraph              (Directed Graph)                        INCOMPLETE

    NEED TO LEARN AND IMPLMENT:

Tries               (Don't know. Yet.)                      NOT STARTED!!
HashTable           (Don't know. Yet.)                      NOT STARTED!!

    POSSIBLE ADDITIONS:

Mnary Trees
